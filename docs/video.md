# Video

Replace this text with the embed code of your video.
You can use Zoom's screen recording or special software like OBS.
Upload to something like YouTube or Google Drive and make sure that the video is publicly accessible.
Then, copy the embed code and paste it in here.
Do not leave any of this original paragraph of text (you can leave the `# Video` part).
You can check your published URL to see if the video was deployed correctly by adding `docs/video` to your deployed site's URL.
